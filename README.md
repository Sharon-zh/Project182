# Project182
1. The problem domain our team is tentatively wanting to focus on Recipe Organizer.

2. For Recipe Organizer, the applications our team is thinking of developing are as follows:
   - store recipes (ingredients, instructions, etc.): save important information of a recipe to the recipe base.
   - organize recipes in some meaningful way, such as alphabetically or by the most viewed recipe...
   - user customization: show a list of the user's favorite recipes or most used recipes, (recommend recipes a user may like by the user's searches if possible).
   - write comments  and likes for recipes: collect the number of likes and all comments other users made for a recipe.
   - search for the recipe by name or by ingredient: show all recipes with the specific searching word or ingredient.

3. The link to the documentation for an API that our team can use related to the domain is as follows:
   https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

4. A screenshot of using a tool to try out the API:
