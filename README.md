# Project182
1. The problem domain our team is tentatively wanting to focus on Recipe Organizer.

2. For Recipe Organizer, the applications our team is thinking of developing are as follows:
   - store recipes (ingredients, instructions, etc.) 
   - organize recipes in some meaningful way 
   - user customization
   - write comments  and likes for recipes
   - search for the recipe by name

3. The link to the documentation for an API that our team can use related to the domain is as follows:
   https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

4. A screenshot of using a tool to try out the API:
